Resilience in networks using topographical data analysis
Operators and regulators of regional and national electric power grids have a responsibility of 
ensuring uninterrupted power supply to homes, industries, and institutions.
The structural integrity of the network of interconnected power stations is critical to the security and economy of the region it supplies the electricity.
However, since it is nearly impossible to prevent failures in the network which may be because of a natural disaster, 
an upgrade to the grid or a deliberate attack by malicious entities, managers of the grid need to find contingencies that will
not completely break the grid, causing blackouts. 
An understanding of the structural robustness of the grid network will enable operators and regulators to make informed decisions that will improve 
the transmission of power and protect the network during events that would disrupt the network.
We present the United States Western States power grid as a model of an undirected and unweighted graph, 
where we assess the resilience of the graph by using a topological data analysis approach in network science. 
Selected centralities of the nodes are calculated, and their distributions are shown in a histogram. We simulate 
failures or attacks on the network at random and by the selected centrality measures and the giant connected component is also 
calculated, which is used as the metric to track the resilience of the network during the simulations. Based on the metrics used we
identify where the power grid is most vulnerable, and this is essential in helping stakeholders 
in the electricity sector make appropriate arrangements to ensure robustness.
